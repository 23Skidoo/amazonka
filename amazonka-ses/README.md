## Description

    Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cost-effective outbound-only
    email-sending service built on the reliable and scalable infrastructure that
    Amazon.com has developed to serve its own customer base. With Amazon SES, you
    can send transactional email, marketing messages, or any other type of
    high-quality content and you only pay for what you use. Along with high
    deliverability, Amazon SES provides easy, real-time access to your sending
    statistics and built-in notifications for bounces, complaints, and deliveries
    to help you fine-tune your email-sending strategy.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ses)
and [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

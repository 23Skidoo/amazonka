## Description

Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets you convert media files that you have stored
in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) into media files in the formats
required by consumer playback devices. For example, you can convert large,
high-quality digital media files into formats that users can play back on
mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elastictranscoder)
and [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/latest/developerguide/api-reference.html).

--
-- The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find
--
--  and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications,
--  see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.
--
-- The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of
--  all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category
--  keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots.
--  You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it,
--  configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks.
--
-- You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
--  within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
--  AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
--  code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.
--  For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs
--  GitHub repository.

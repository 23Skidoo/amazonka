## Description

CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account
and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information
includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the
source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned
by the service.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudtrail)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

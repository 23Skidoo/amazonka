## Description

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control
access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can
create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny
their access to AWS resources.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-iam)
and [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

## Description

Amazon Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an Amazon
resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change
notifications to enable security and governance. With Amazon Config you can
discover existing Amazon resources, export a complete inventory of your
Amazon resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource
was configured at any point in time. These capabilities enable compliance
auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-config)
and [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

## Description

Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) is a web service that makes it easy to
process large amounts of data efficiently. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop processing
combined with several AWS products to do such tasks as web indexing, data
mining, log file analysis, machine learning, scientific simulation, and data
warehousing.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-emr)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/API/Welcome.html).

## Description

Amazon ElastiCache

Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up,
operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.

With ElastiCache, customers gain all of the benefits of a
high-performance, in-memory cache with far less of the administrative
burden of launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes
setup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a
self-managed cache deployment.

In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get
enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with
their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elasticache)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

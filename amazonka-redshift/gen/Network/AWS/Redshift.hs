-- | Amazon Redshift __Overview__
--
-- This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains
-- documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you
-- can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is
-- asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques,
-- such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a
-- command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions
-- indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance
-- reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the
-- Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces>.
--
-- Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and
-- scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing
-- up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift
-- engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for
-- your business and customers.
--
-- If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you
-- begin by reading the The
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide>
--
-- If you are a database developer, the
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide>
-- explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that
-- make up your data warehouse.

-- | Auto Scaling allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down
-- automatically according to conditions you define. With Auto Scaling, you
-- can ensure that the number of Amazon EC2 instances youâ€™re using increases
-- seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance, and decreases
-- automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs. Auto Scaling is
-- particularly well suited for applications that experience hourly, daily, or
-- weekly variability in usage. Auto Scaling is enabled by Amazon CloudWatch
-- and available at no additional charge beyond Amazon CloudWatch fees.

-- | There are two primary Auto Scaling process types--Launch and Terminate. The
-- Launch process creates a new Amazon EC2 instance for an Auto Scaling group,
-- and the Terminate process removes an existing Amazon EC2 instance. The
-- remaining Auto Scaling process types relate to specific Auto Scaling
-- features: AddToLoadBalancer AlarmNotification AZRebalance HealthCheck
-- ReplaceUnhealthy ScheduledActions If you suspend Launch or Terminate, all
-- other process types are affected to varying degrees. The following
-- descriptions discuss how each process type is affected by a suspension of
-- Launch or Terminate. The AddToLoadBalancer process type adds instances to
-- the load balancer when the instances are launched. If you suspend this
-- process, Auto Scaling will launch the instances but will not add them to
-- the load balancer. If you resume the AddToLoadBalancer process, Auto
-- Scaling will also resume adding new instances to the load balancer when
-- they are launched. However, Auto Scaling will not add running instances
-- that were launched while the process was suspended; those instances must be
-- added manually using the the RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer call in the
-- Elastic Load Balancing API Reference. The AlarmNotification process type
-- accepts notifications from Amazon CloudWatch alarms that are associated
-- with the Auto Scaling group. If you suspend the AlarmNotification process
-- type, Auto Scaling will not automatically execute scaling policies that
-- would be triggered by alarms. Although the AlarmNotification process type
-- is not directly affected by a suspension of Launch or Terminate, alarm
-- notifications are often used to signal that a change in the size of the
-- Auto Scaling group is warranted. If you suspend Launch or Terminate, Auto
-- Scaling might not be able to implement the alarm's associated policy. The
-- AZRebalance process type seeks to maintain a balanced number of instances
-- across Availability Zones within a Region. If you remove an Availability
-- Zone from your Auto Scaling group or an Availability Zone otherwise becomes
-- unhealthy or unavailable, Auto Scaling launches new instances in an
-- unaffected Availability Zone before terminating the unhealthy or
-- unavailable instances. When the unhealthy Availability Zone returns to a
-- healthy state, Auto Scaling automatically redistributes the application
-- instances evenly across all of the designated Availability Zones. If you
-- call SuspendProcesses on the launch process type, the AZRebalance process
-- will neither launch new instances nor terminate existing instances. This is
-- because the AZRebalance process terminates existing instances only after
-- launching the replacement instances. If you call SuspendProcesses on the
-- terminate process type, the AZRebalance process can cause your Auto Scaling
-- group to grow up to ten percent larger than the maximum size. This is
-- because Auto Scaling allows groups to temporarily grow larger than the
-- maximum size during rebalancing activities. If Auto Scaling cannot
-- terminate instances, your Auto Scaling group could remain up to ten percent
-- larger than the maximum size until you resume the terminate process type.
-- The HealthCheck process type checks the health of the instances. Auto
-- Scaling marks an instance as unhealthy if Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load
-- Balancing informs Auto Scaling that the instance is unhealthy. The
-- HealthCheck process can override the health status of an instance that you
-- set with SetInstanceHealth. The ReplaceUnhealthy process type terminates
-- instances that are marked as unhealthy and subsequently creates new
-- instances to replace them. This process calls both of the primary process
-- types--first Terminate and then Launch. The HealthCheck process type works
-- in conjunction with the ReplaceUnhealthly process type to provide health
-- check functionality. If you suspend either Launch or Terminate, the
-- ReplaceUnhealthy process type will not function properly. The
-- ScheduledActions process type performs scheduled actions that you create
-- with PutScheduledUpdateGroupAction. Scheduled actions often involve
-- launching new instances or terminating existing instances. If you suspend
-- either Launch or Terminate, your scheduled actions might not function as
-- expected.

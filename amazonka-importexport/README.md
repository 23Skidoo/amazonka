## Description

    AWS Import/Export accelerates moving large amounts of data into and out of
    AWS using portable storage devices for transport. AWS transfers your data
    directly onto and off of storage devices using Amazonâ€™s high-speed internal
    network and bypassing the Internet. For significant data sets, AWS
    Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective
    than upgrading your connectivity.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-importexport)
and [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/DG/api-reference.html).

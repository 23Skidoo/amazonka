For pull requests which affect generated output, please _do not include_ the
actual regenerated service code, only commit the updates to the generator, config and annex.

Despite being deterministic it allows the Continuous Integration process to be the
single source of truth for generated code changes, and keeps pull requests
readable and focused on actual changes.

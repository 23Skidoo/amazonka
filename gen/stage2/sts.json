You must use IAM user credentials or temporary security credentials to call \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRole\u003c/code\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html\"\u003eRoles\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing IAM\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRole\u003c/code\u003e (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console.

The default is 1 hour. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOptionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed, \u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eand\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed.

The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. You must also have a policy that allows you to call \u003ccode\u003ests:AssumeRole\u003c/code\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003eUsing MFA with AssumeRole\u003c/b\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRole\u003c/code\u003e. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003ccode\u003e\"Condition\": {\"Null\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthAge\": false}}\u003c/code\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor more information, see \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\"\u003eConfiguring MFA-Protected API Access\u003c/a\u003e in the \u003ci\u003eUsing IAM\u003c/i\u003e guide. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo use MFA with \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRole\u003c/code\u003e, you pass values for the \u003ccode\u003eSerialNumber\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eTokenCode\u003c/code\u003e parameters.

A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. Because you must call the \u003ccode\u003eGetFederationToken\u003c/code\u003e action using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003eNote:\u003c/b\u003e Do not use this call in mobile applications or client-based web applications that directly get temporary security credentials. For those types of applications, use \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eGetFederationToken\u003c/code\u003e action must be called by using the long-term AWS security credentials of an IAM user. You can also call \u003ccode\u003eGetFederationToken\u003c/code\u003e using the security credentials of an AWS account (root), but this is not recommended. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application and then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources they need access to. For more information, see \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html\"\u003eIAM Best Practices\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing IAM\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the long-term credentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified duration, between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 129600 seconds (36 hours).

When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy attached to the federated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials were used to call \u003ccode\u003eGetFederationToken\u003c/code\u003e. AWS allows the federated user's request only when both the federated user \u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eand\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user policy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are used to call \u003ccode\u003eGetFederationToken\u003c/code\u003e are designed to allow access to all the actions and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual users, you pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level that's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have no effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that specifically allows the federated user to access the resource. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor more information about how permissions work, see \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/permissions-get-federation-token.html\"\u003ePermissions for GetFederationToken\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing Temporary Security Credentials\u003c/i\u003e.

This operation provides a mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store or directory to role-based AWS access without user-specific credentials or configuration. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS services. The credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRoleWithSAML\u003c/code\u003e, which can be up to 3600 seconds (1 hour) or until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's \u003ccode\u003eNotOnOrAfter\u003c/code\u003e value, whichever is shorter.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOptionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed, \u003ci\u003e\u003cb\u003eand\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/i\u003e the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/permissions-assume-role.html\"\u003ePermissions for AssumeRoleWithSAML\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing Temporary Security Credentials\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore your application can call \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRoleWithSAML\u003c/code\u003e, you must configure your SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the claims required by AWS. Additionally, you must use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your AWS account that represents your identity provider, and create an IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCalling \u003ccode\u003eAssumeRoleWithSAML\u003c/code\u003e does not require the use of AWS security credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor more information, see the following resources:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/CreatingSAML.html\"\u003eCreating Temporary Security Credentials for SAML Federation\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing Temporary Security Credentials\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/idp-managing-identityproviders.html\"\u003eSAML Providers\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing IAM\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/create-role-saml-IdP-tasks.html\"\u003eConfiguring a Relying Party and Claims\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing IAM\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/create-role-saml.html\"\u003eCreating a Role for SAML-Based Federation\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ci\u003eUsing IAM\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003cmember name=\"RoleArn\" target=\"arnType\"\u003e\u003c/member\u003e \u003cmember name=\"SAMLAssertion\" target=\"SAMLAssertionType\"\u003e\u003c/member\u003e \u003cmember name=\"Policy\" target=\"sessionPolicyDocumentType\"\u003e\u003c/member\u003e \u003cmember name=\"DurationSeconds\" target=\"roleDurationSecondsType\"\u003e\u003c/member\u003e",

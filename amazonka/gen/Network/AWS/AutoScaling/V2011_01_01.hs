-- | Auto Scaling allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down
-- automatically according to conditions you define. With Auto Scaling, you
-- can ensure that the number of Amazon EC2 instances youâ€™re using increases
-- seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance, and decreases
-- automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs. Auto Scaling is
-- particularly well suited for applications that experience hourly, daily, or
-- weekly variability in usage. Auto Scaling is enabled by Amazon CloudWatch
-- and available at no additional charge beyond Amazon CloudWatch fees.

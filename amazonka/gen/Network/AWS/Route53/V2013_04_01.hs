-- | Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It
-- provides secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses
-- Amazon Web Services (AWS) products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
-- (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Simple Storage Service
-- (Amazon S3). You can also use Amazon Route 53 to route users to your
-- infrastructure outside of AWS.

-- | AWS Support is a one-on-one, fast-response support channel that is staffed
-- with experienced support personnel. The service helps customers get the
-- most from the products and features provided by Amazon Web Services. There
-- are four levels, or tiers, of AWS Support: Basic, Developer, Business, and
-- Enterprise. The Basic tier is free of charge and offers support for account
-- and billing questions and service limit increases. The other tiers offer an
-- unlimited number of technical support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing
-- and no long-term contracts, providing developers and businesses flexibility
-- to choose the level of support that meets their needs.

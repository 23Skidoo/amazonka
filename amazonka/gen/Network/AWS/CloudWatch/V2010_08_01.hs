-- | Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the
-- applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and
-- track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon
-- CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon
-- DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics
-- generated by your applications and services, and any log files your
-- applications generate. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide
-- visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
-- operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your
-- application running smoothly.

-- | Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
-- applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon
-- SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a
-- component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the application
-- involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in
-- accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you
-- full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying
-- about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and
-- maintaining their state.

-- not make sense in the current context of the workflow execution and will
-- therefore fail. A limit on your account was reached. The decision lacks
-- sufficient permissions. One of the following events might be added to the
-- history to indicate an error. The event attribute's cause parameter
-- indicates the cause. If cause is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED, the
-- decision failed because it lacked sufficient permissions.
-- ScheduleActivityTaskFailed a ScheduleActivityTask decision failed. This
-- could happen if the activity type specified in the decision is not
-- registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision is not properly
-- configured. RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed a RequestCancelActivityTask
-- decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with
-- the specified activityId. StartTimerFailed a StartTimer decision failed.
-- This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.
-- CancelTimerFailed a CancelTimer decision failed. This could happen if there
-- is no open timer with the specified timerId.
-- StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed a StartChildWorkflowExecution decision
-- failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified is not registered,
-- is deprecated, or the decision is not properly configured.
-- SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed a SignalExternalWorkflowExecution
-- decision failed. This could happen if the workflowID specified in the
-- decision was incorrect. RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed a
-- RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen
-- if the workflowID specified in the decision was incorrect.
-- CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed a CancelWorkflowExecution decision failed.
-- This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the
-- workflow execution. CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed a
-- CompleteWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an
-- unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.
-- ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed a ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution
-- decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task
-- pending in the workflow execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution
-- decision was not configured correctly. FailWorkflowExecutionFailed a
-- FailWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an
-- unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution. The preceding
-- error events might occur due to an error in the decider logic, which might
-- put the workflow execution in an unstable state The cause field in the
-- event structure for the error event indicates the cause of the error. A
-- workflow execution may be closed by the decider by returning one of the
-- following decisions when completing a decision task:
-- CompleteWorkflowExecution, FailWorkflowExecution, CancelWorkflowExecution
-- and ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution. An UnhandledDecision fault will be
-- returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or
-- activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was
-- being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic
-- issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a
-- distributed system. The right action here is to call
-- RespondDecisionTaskCompleted without any decisions. This would result in
-- another decision task with these new events included in the history. The

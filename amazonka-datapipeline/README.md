## Description

AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that you can use to automate the movement and transformation of data. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can define data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the successful completion of previous tasks.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-datapipeline)
and [AWS API Reference]().

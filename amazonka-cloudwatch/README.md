## Description

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the
applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and
track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon
CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon
DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics
generated by your applications and services, and any log files your
applications generate. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide
visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your
application running smoothly.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudwatch)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

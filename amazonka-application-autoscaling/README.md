## Description

Application Auto Scaling is a general purpose Auto Scaling service for supported elastic AWS resources. With Application Auto Scaling, you can automatically scale your AWS resources, with an experience similar to that of Auto Scaling.

Application Auto Scaling supports scaling the following AWS resources:

-   Amazon ECS services

-   Amazon EC2 Spot fleet instances

You can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the following tasks:

-   Define scaling policies for automatically adjusting your AWS resources

-   Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms

-   View history of your scaling events

Application Auto Scaling is available in the following regions:

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-application-autoscaling)
and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

## Description

Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It
provides secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses Amazon
Web Services (AWS) products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
You can also use Amazon Route 53 to route users to your infrastructure
outside of AWS.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-route53)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

## Description

Amazon CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications. You can use Amazon CodeDeploy to automate deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations, and the service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to one EC2 instance or thousands.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codedeploy).

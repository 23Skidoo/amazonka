## Description

Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon
SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a
component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the application
involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in
accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you
full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying
about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining
their state.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-swf)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/Welcome.html).

## Description

Amazon Simple Workflow Service

The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
applications that use Amazon\'s cloud to coordinate work across
distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a /task/ represents a logical
unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow.
Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask
dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical
flow of the application.

Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and
coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as
tracking their progress and maintaining their state.

This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of
the Amazon SWF programming model, see the
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ Amazon SWF Developer Guide>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-swf)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/Welcome.html).

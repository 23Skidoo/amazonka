## Description

Elastic Load Balancing

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming web traffic
across multiple Amazon EC2 instances.

All Elastic Load Balancing actions and commands are /idempotent/, which
means that they complete no more than one time. If you repeat a request
or a command, the action succeeds with a 200 OK response code.

For detailed information about the features of Elastic Load Balancing,
see
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/UserScenarios.html Managing Load Balancers>
in the /Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide/.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elb)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

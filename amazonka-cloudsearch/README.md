## Description

Amazon CloudSearch Configuration Service

You use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service to create,
configure, and manage search domains. Configuration service requests are
submitted using the AWS Query protocol. AWS Query requests are HTTP or
HTTPS requests submitted via HTTP GET or POST with a query parameter
named Action.

The endpoint for configuration service requests is region-specific:
cloudsearch./region/.amazonaws.com. For example,
cloudsearch.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For a current list of supported
regions and endpoints, see
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloudsearch_region Regions and Endpoints>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudsearch)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/what-is-cloudsearch.html).

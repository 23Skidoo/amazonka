description:
    AWS Support is a one-on-one, fast-response support channel that is staffed with experienced support personnel.
    .
    The service helps customers get the most from the products and features provided by Amazon Web Services.
    .
    There are four levels, or tiers, of AWS Support: Basic, Developer, Business, and Enterprise.
    .
    The Basic tier is free of charge and offers support for account and billing questions and service limit increases.
    .
    The other tiers offer an unlimited number of technical support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing and no long-term contracts, providing developers and businesses flexibility to choose the level of support that meets their needs.

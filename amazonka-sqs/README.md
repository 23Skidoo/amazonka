## Description

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully
managed message queuing service. SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to
decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use SQS to transmit
any volume of data, at any level of throughput, without losing messages or
requiring other services to be always available. With SQS, you can offload
the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available
messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sqs)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

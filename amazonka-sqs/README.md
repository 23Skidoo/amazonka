## Description

    Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully
    managed message queuing service. SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to
    decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use SQS to transmit
    any volume of data, at any level of throughput, without losing messages or
    requiring other services to be always available. With SQS, you can offload
    the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available
    messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sqs)
and [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

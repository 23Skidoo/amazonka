## Description

Amazon Kinesis is a managed service that scales elastically for real-time processing of streaming big data. The service takes in large streams of data records that can then be consumed in real time by multiple data-processing applications that can be run on Amazon EC2 instances.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-kinesis).

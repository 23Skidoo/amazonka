## Description

Amazon Kinesis is a managed service that scales elastically for real-time
processing of streaming big data. The service takes in large streams of data
records that can then be consumed in real time by multiple data-processing
applications that can be run on Amazon EC2 instances.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-kinesis)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

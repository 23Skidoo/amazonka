## Description

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fast, flexible, fully
managed push messaging service. Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost-effective
to push notifications to Apple, Google, Fire OS, and Windows devices, as well
as Android devices in China with Baidu Cloud Push. You can also use SNS to
push notifications to internet connected smart devices, as well as other
distributed services. Besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile
devices, Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text message or
email, to Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues, or to any HTTP endpoint.
To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are
stored redundantly across multiple availability zones.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sns)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/Welcome.html).
